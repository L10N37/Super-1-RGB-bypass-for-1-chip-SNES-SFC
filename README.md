# Super-1-RGB-bypass-for-1-chip-SNES-SFC

An RGB bypass board for 1-chip SNES/ SFC consoles (Phat & JR). Corrects brightness and wash out issues, attenuated to 0.7vpp output (correct video standards). Uses an LT6550 driver.
RGB may be used to encode the other signals (composite/ S video)
hence, the install methods may kill these outputs. Leaving the factory coupling caps in place will retain the outputs.
